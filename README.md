This is the source path for my blog, which you can find at this link " http://eev.ee/.

The bulk of it consists of Markdown-formatted posts in `content/`, but perhaps you'll find the theme interesting too.

It's powered by [Pelican][], a Python static blog system.

Feel free to send pull requests for any type of error or factual errors or anything else.
